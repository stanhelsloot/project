      <h1>Induced earthquakes in the Netherlands as a result of gas extraction</h1>

        <h3>Gasfield</h3>
        <p>In 1959 one of the worlds largest gas reserves was discovered in
          Groningen, a province in the
          northeast of the Netherlands. Four years after its discovery, gas
          extraction begun. Earthquakes have since causes large amounts of
          structural damages.[1] This page touch on all gas extracted from Dutch
          soil. The numbers for amount of gas extracted are rounden to billion (M)
          cubic meters (m^3) and are all measured at standard (N) conditions
          (0 degrees C and 1 atmosphere). All magnitudes of the earthquakes are
          on the Richter Scale. To show the relation between the earthquakes and
          the gas extraction, this page provides several visualizations to
          clarify the situation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Extraction</h3>
      <p>Over the past "two decades" gas extraction has been heavily reduced
        due to demages caused by induced earthquakes.[2] The current goal is to
        keep reducing gas extraction and to lower the total extraction to
        less then five billion Nm^3 in 2023. Several measures are taken
        to speed up the reduction, such as limiting export to neighbouring
        countries and building a nitrogen factory which can be used to convert
        highly caloric types of gas to the low caloric type, which is used for
        coocking and heating appliances. To show the current trend of decreasing
        gas extraction, two plots have been made. On the right, a plot showing the
        yearly totals of gas extracted, and to the left a plot showing the total
        amounts of gas extracted per month. Clicking on the bars of the plot on
        the right will change the year of which the months are displayed.</p>

      <h3>Earthquakes</h3>
      <p>Starting in 1911, the KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute)
        has been keeping a record of earthquakes occuring or affecting the
        Netherlands. The first earthquake caused by gas extraction, a so called
        induced earthquake, was
        detected in Assen in 1986 and had a magnitude of 2.8 on the Richter
        scale.[3] After this, the amount of earthquakes per year has increased
        significantly in quantity as can be seen in figure to the right. These
        induced earthquakes differ from tectonic earthquakes
        mainly in the depth of occurence. Induced earthquakes have an approximate
        depth of 3 km, whilst naturally occuring earthquake occur between
        20 and 100 km depth.
        In 2015 extra seismographs have been installed throughout the Netherlands,
        allowing for detection of earthquakes with magnitudes of below 1.5 on
        the Richter scale. These earthquakes were not used in the visualizations
        on this page. To the right is a visualization of the amount of earthquakes
        occuring in a certain range on the Richter scale. Clicking on one of the bars
        will show the selected year on the left, which is a map
        of the Netherlands on which the earthquakes are visualized.</p>

      <h3>Investigating relations</h3>
      <p>The two figures above show a clear increase in the total amount of earthquakes
        occuring each year. Whilst there are years pre 2010 were many earthquakes
        were detected, these earthquakes are scattered throughout the Netherlands. 
        Now some insight has been provided on the amounts of gas extracted and
         the occur
        Now that we have some insight on the amounts of gas extracted and the
        locations and magnitudes of the earthquakes we can investigate this
        problem more excessive. The data on monthly gas extraction shows
        that most gas is extracted between October and March. Do most earthquakes
        also occur in this time period?</p>
