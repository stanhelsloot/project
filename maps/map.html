      <h1>Induced earthquakes in the Netherlands as a result of gas extraction</h1>
      <p>By Stan Helsloot hallo</p>
        <h3>Gasfield</h3>
        <p>In 1959 one of the worlds largest gas reserves was discovered in
          Groningen, a province in the
          northeast of the Netherlands. Four years after its discovery, gas
          extraction begun. Earthquakes have since causes large amounts of
          structural damages.[1] To show the relation between the earthquakes and
          the gas extraction, this page provides several visualizations to
          clarify the situation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Extraction</h3>
      <p>Over the past "two decades" gas extraction has been heavily reduced
        due to demages caused by induced earthquakes.[2] The current goal is to
        keep reducing gas extraction and to lower the total extraction to
        less then five billion Nm^3 in 2023.[3] Several measures are taken
        to speed up the reduction, such as limiting export to neighbouring
        countries and building a nitrogen factory which can be used to convert
        highly caloric types of gas to the low caloric type.</p>

      <h3>Earthquakes</h3>
      <p>Starting in 1911, the KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute)
        has been keeping a record of earthquakes occuring or affecting the
        Netherlands. The first earthquake caused by gas extraction was
        detected in Assen in 1986 and had a magnitude of 2.8 on the Richter
        scale.[4] After this, the amount of earthquakes has increased significantly
        in quantity as can be seen in figure "stacked_year". These earthquakes,
        refered to as induced earthquakes, differ from tectonic earthquakes
        mainly in the depth of occurence. Induced earthquakes have an approximate
        depth of 3 km, whilst naturally occuring earthquake occur between
        20 and 100 km depth.
        In 2015 extra seismographs have been installed throughout the Netherlands,
        allowing for detection of earthquakes with magnitudes of below 1.5 on
        the Richter scale. These earthquakes were not used in the visualizations
        on this page.</p>
