research proposal by Stan Helsloot, student number 10762388

From 1911 the KNMI collects seismic data throughout the Netherlands.
Whilst the Netherlands is not located near any tectonic plates, earthquakes,
however small, are still a common occurrence. These earthquakes mainly occur
in the province Groningen where one of the worlds largest gas reserves
was discovered in 1959. Since 1963 this natural gas is being extracted.
Many citizens in Groningen have since been affected by the earthquakes,
which have resulted in structural damage throughout the province.

The earthquakes and its effects are a recurring theme in many news
outlets and debates and many reports claim that there has been an increase
in both seismic power and frequency due to natural gas extraction.
These claims often only address changes in comparison to last year.
The goal of this project is to show the relation (or lack of) between fracking
and seismic activity for people who want evidence for the claims made by
media outlets.

Summary:
Provide a tool to see the relation between the extraction of natural gas
in Groningen and seismic activity in the area.

Main features:
(See picture in this folder for sketches)
1)
- A map of the Netherlands. Seismic activity in circles per year.
  Slider to change year
- (Bar)graph of (seismic activity/extraction totals) per (10?)year.
- Information of the seismic data (strength & radius)
- General information of the gas extraction

2)
- For the map: hovering over the circles to see the date/strength/radius
- Show effect of rules/laws imposed by the government on the seismic activity.
- When hovering over bar graph, display average strength of the earthquakes
