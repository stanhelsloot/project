# Problem Statement
In the pas decades the amount of earthquakes as a result of gas extraction
in Dutch gas fields has increased significantly, resulting in an increase
in the damages to properties located around the gas fields. Various news
outlets have indicated a severe increase of earthquakes, often without
showing actual numbers.

# Solution
To provide more insight on the matter, I have made a website containing
several visualizations which show the amount of gas that has been extracted,
the location and frequency of earthquakes and the relation between the two.
