# Wednesday week 1
- Decided to use both monthly and yearly barcharts for better interaction
  between the different visualizations.
- Finished preprocessing and included some extra parts in the json files.
# Thursday week 1
- Changed layout of website to include more pages (3 in total) to separate
  part of the text and the visualizations (things like personal info, locations
    data etc.)
- Started combining .js files in the map.html file. Was an enourmous challange due
  to limited knowledge of javascript. and started working on
  the first interaction.
# Friday week 1
- Worked on making functions and variables more global so they could be used in
  various functions; was more of an obstacle then expected.
- Worked on interaction between bar graphs
- Ran into problems with using the yScale functions resulting in the barchart not
  properly updating
# Monday week 2
- Fixed interaction between bar_year and bar_month! Can now click on a year to display
  the monthly gas extraction.
- Started working on adding epicenters into the mix.
- And it works! clicking on a year in the year bar chart displays the bar stuff
  and the map stuff. A wait time was implemented to make sure all circles were
  removed (which also uses transitions (looks better)) but this looks a tad
  too slow.
