# Wednesday week 1
- Decided to use both monthly and yearly barcharts for better interaction
  between the different visualizations.
- Finished preprocessing and included some extra parts in the json files.
# Thursday week 1
- Changed layout of website to include more pages (3 in total) to separate
  part of the text and the visualizations (things like personal info, locations
    data etc.)
- Started combining .js files in the map.html file and started working on
  the first interaction.
